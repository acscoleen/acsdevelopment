<p align="justify">[dropcap]W[/dropcap]hether you need to get your company's design or logo out there, or looking for a way to sell your designs, our custom screen printing is the answer. We use plastisol inks in our custom screen printing‚Äîit contains no air-polluting solvents or volatile organic compounds. This type of screen printing does not have a plastic, heat transfer feel-it's a high quality screen print. You can rest assured that your screen printed towels are truly safe for¬†the environment right from the start. Our screen printing technique lasts a long time even after repeated washing.¬†We also offer digital printing, which allows us to print smaller runs with a large amount of detail, so whether you are looking to print one piece or 500 pieces, we can help you.</p>

<ol>
<li> You need to send your chosen design via <a title="Screenprinting Submit" href="http://www.acshomeandwork.com/screenprinting/">email</a> in a PDF file. Vectored art files are preferable.

<li>There is a $50/hour charge for any design that has to be redrawn or reformatted.</li>

<li>If you have a certain color you want, please provide the Pantone color number, or request it to be matched.</li>

<li>Each new design submitted will have a <em>one time art set</em>¬†up fee of $50 for standard screen printing, or $25 for digital printing.</li>

<li>Screen changes are $20 per color (a <em>one time charge</em>, as screens rarely need to be replaced), and a $6 wash screen charge, for color changes on the same screen. Digital printing does not use screens, so there are no charges.</li>
